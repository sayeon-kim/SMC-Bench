#### The Simple Modification Code Replacing Instruction

Before modifying, This program print a text "Exit Program." and terminate program.

But This code changes nop instruction into jmp halt, So loop infinitely with printing a text "This code is modified".

This SMC Code doesn't mess memory because nop instructions take place.
